### WE ARE LISTENING.

A musical experiment in giving up your privacy, surveillance, sharing and spying. 

Would you be willing to surrender your privacy in order to gain the ability to creep on others?

By installing the app you allow other Spotify users within your vicinity to eavesdrop in on what you are listening to. Likewise, you have the power to hear what strangers are listening to.
